### Host side Corner Detection using Harris Filtering on OAK-D

![2021-04-10-194523_848x480_scrot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67831664/114272918-aa894880-9a35-11eb-92c6-a51af9246ab9.png)

The Red dots placed here, are edges, and they are filtered using Harris filtering. This is not Canny detection, but I'll post
the code for that too.

> This example can be run without Power source for OAK-D

Run - 
```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

python3 edge-harris.py
```

This will run the example.
